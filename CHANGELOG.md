# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This project is **not** using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(I still going to use same-looking versioning with three numbers separated with dots, 
just to highlight big changes when changing MAJOR or MINOR numbers, but is not used for 
backward compatibility)

## [Unreleased]

null

## [0.0.1] - 2022.05.27

### Added

- This is the first changelog of the Dinora project. The engine is in the early stages of development:
it can play some chess, but the engine is weak
- You can train supervised NN by providing PGN. But it is a blind experience: no graphs or logs, 
and most parameters are default e.g. learning rate.
- To play with the engine you can install any UCI-compatible GUI and follow readme installation.
