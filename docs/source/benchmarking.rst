Benchmarking
===============================================================

Here is info about benchmarking various parts of Dinora engine.
Benchmarking needed to improve chess engine speed, which leads to
producing better moves in less time.

Running benchmarks
------------------

Dinora uses pytest and pytest-benchmark for this task.
All benchmarks are stored under tests/bench

.. code-block:: text

    $ pytest tests/bench

Improve engine speed
--------------------

Before you start working on improvements. Capture current speed

.. code-block:: text

    $ pytest tests/bench --benchmark-save=<your-name>

It will save benchmark as <some_number>_<your-name>.json
Write some code and run benchmark again

.. code-block:: text

    $ pytest tests/bench --benchmark-save=<my-improvements>

Also saved as <new_number>_<my_improvements>.json
After this you can compare benchmark results

.. code-block:: text

    $ pytest-benchmark compare <some_number> <new_number>
